Model Details

    The model is a supervised regression model.
    It utilizes linear regression to predict customer spending limits.
    Feature engineering is applied to enhance model performance.

MLOps Integration

    We've integrated the model with an MLOps system, making it easy for business users to upload, train, and test the model through a user-friendly interface.

Explanations AI

    Explanations AI functionality is implemented to provide insights into model outcomes.
    It helps business users understand why a specific spending limit was predicted for a customer.

Visual Data Analysis

    The MLOps system includes data visualization tools for better comprehension of model outcomes.
    These visualizations offer insights into customer segments and spending patterns.
